# Worldpay Within - The Java SDK

The Java implementation for the Worldpay Within IoT payment SDK. This SDK, or Software Development Kit, enables smart devices to discover each other, negogiate a price for services, make a payment (through the Worldpay payments gateway) for services, and then consume services via a 'trusted trigger'. For more information see our documentation website here: http://www.worldpaywithin.com

## Get started
1. Download this repo
2. Add the example projects to netbeans (or go it alone creating your own project from the source code and jars - In your project, reference `WPWithin.jar` from the releases section and the other jars in lib)
3. Run the examples...

## Run the examples
* Run the consumer project
* Simultaneously run the producer or producer-callbacks project
* The two smart devices should communicate with each other and make a payment

## Compatibility and pre-requisites
* Assumption here is you have the Java 1.7 JRE at least
* Java 1.7 SDK even better

## See the payments:
1. Sign up to https://online.worldpay.com if you haven't already done so
2. Got to settings > API keys and get your test keys
3. Replace the keys in the consumer and producer java example source files
4. Re-run the examples and you should see the payments coming through on the WPOP (Worldpay Online) payments dashboard

## Debugging:
* If you get some odd error messages talking about a 'rpc-agent'
* Try typing the following command: 'ps -e | grep rpc' to get the pid(s) of rpc-agents that are running. 
* Then do kill &lt;pid&gt; e.g. kill 13249234 to kill these processes.
* Try re-running the examples - if this fails then please contact us at innovation@worldpay.com or on our slack channel or raise an issue in github.
  
## So what does it do:

![The Worldpay Within Flows sequence diagram](http://wptechinnovation.github.io/worldpay-within-sdk/images/architecture/serviceOverview.png)

You can see there are four phases; discover, negotiation, payment and then service delivery, for more information visit our website at http://www.worldpaywithin.com.
